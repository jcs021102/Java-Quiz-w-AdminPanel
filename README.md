# Java-Quiz-w-AdminPanel
This was an assignment during my second year of university.

The project was a rather rushed job, only spending around 4 days on it total. 

## Features 

1. Admin panel,for adding, removing and editing quizes
2. CSV based file storage
3. Optional SQL based file storage (via changing a single line of code as per assesment requirements)
4. Fully Object oriented with inheritence.
5. Unit Testing implemented along side a number of integration tests allowing for 100% code coverage. 

## Improvements

1. The code could have been abstracted further, but doing so would have led to `method churn`, which ends up slowing development in the long term.
2. GUI could have looked better, but in this assignment no marks were given for UX.
